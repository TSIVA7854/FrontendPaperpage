            <h3>About Book</h3>
            <p>Reading is defined as the process of looking at written symbols and interpreting their meaning. It involves using our eyes to receive written symbols (letters, punctuation marks, and spaces) and our brain to convert them into words, sentences, and paragraphs that communicate information. Reading can be done silently or aloud and is considered a receptive skill, as it allows us to receive information.
